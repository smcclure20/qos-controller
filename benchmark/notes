Benchmarking plan:
- How fast the controller/aggregator can handle (many) updates
    - Set up a bunch of host clients on another VM and send a bunch of frequent updates
    - Check when it maxes a resource
- Throughput of the changes on the host (?)
- Latency of the changes on the host (?)
- Stress out the hash table
    - Have a bunch of tiny flows ...?
- Accuracy as a function of the reporting/aggregation intervals
    - Can do this with one client node
    - Send traffic/to from client and try out different intervals
    - See how much straying one can get (how would this even be possible?)
